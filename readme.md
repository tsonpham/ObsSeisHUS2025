- A/Prof. Lê Hồng Phương (HUS)
- Dr. Nguyễn Thị Minh Huyền (HUS)
- A/Prof. Trần Thanh Tuấn (HUS)

Venue: VNU Hanoi University of Science, 334 Nguyễn Trãi, Thanh Xuân, Hà Nội.

## Overview
This workshop  in a practical introduction to Observational Seismology. 

### Learning outcomes
* Introduction to digital seismic data, including (1) principles of seismometry, (2) seismic data as digital signals, (3) global seismic databases, (4) basic data processing tools. 
* Introduction to geographical mapping skills + visualize scientific data, including (1) Python package to draw a geophysical map of a region, (2) plotting scientific data on a map.
* Introduction to inverse problem theory and classical inverse problems in seismology: (1) earthquake location and (2) seismic moment tensor inversion. 
* Introduction to cross-correlation techniques (i.e., relatively modern seismology technique): theory and example of autocorrelation for shallow Earth imaging.
* A brief introduction to machine learning in seismology: automatic earthquake detection. 

### About lecturer
[Dr. Phạm](https://www.tsonpham.net/) is an observational seismologist, who uses seismic waves to understand the Earth’s interior structures and seismic energy sources using mathematical tools, such as signal processing, numerical modeling, and geophysical inference. He is particularly interested in structures and processes a few kilometers beneath the surface, such as polar ice sheets, down to the Earth’s deepest shell, including its cores. To date, one of his visible contributions is to help understand better the architecture of the seismic wavefield several hours after large earthquakes and use it to decipher several long-lasting puzzles regarding the Earth’s inner core. In current and near-future research, he aims to expand my seismological toolbox to advance research on the topics, focusing on understanding the structures and dynamics of the polar ice sheets in Antarctica and Greenland in the changing climate.
